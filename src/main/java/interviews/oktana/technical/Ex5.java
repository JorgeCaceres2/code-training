/*
* Analyze the provided number and print the following result for each type of number:
DEFICIENT: ‘-1’
The sums of all it’s divisors it’s LESS THAN the number itself,
e.g. for 15,
it’s divisors are 1, 3 and 5, so the sum is 9,
since 9 is less than 15, then 15 is a deficient number.
PERFECT: ‘0’
the sums of all it’s divisors it’s EQUAL TO the number itself,
e.g. for 6,
it’s divisors are 1, 2 and 3, so the sum is 6,
since 6 is equal to 6, then 6 is a perfect number.
ABUNDANT: ‘1’
the sums of all it’s divisors it’s GREATER THAN the number itself,
e.g. for 20,
it’s divisors are 1, 2, 4, 5 and 10, so the sum is 22,
since 22 is greater than 20, then 20 is an abundant number.
